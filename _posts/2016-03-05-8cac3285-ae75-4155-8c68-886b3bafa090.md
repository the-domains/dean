In May of 2010, my company Lightroom kicked off a huge marketing initiative with Colliers Residential and Jupiter Adria for the Residences at Dubrovnik Sun Gardens.  These fully completed, finely appointed luxury residences all feature sweeping views of the Adriatic Sea.  I got immersed in the project during a week long on-location video and still photography shoot, during which we created a wealth of assets of the resort property and the surrounding country side.

> ... Those who seek paradise on Earth should come to Dubrovnik ... - George Bernard Shaw

The Old city of Dubrovnik is spell-binding.  The stone streets wind around Cathedrals and ancient monasteries and open on to large squares lined with coffee shops and art galleries.  There are many ways to loose yourself -- spend a day perched on a rocky outcropping sipping Pivo as the sun shimmers on the blue waters of the Adriatic, stroll through the many museums and art galleries, enjoy live Jazz on an outdoor terrace, or hole up in a Pub and chat with locals and travellers.

Up the coast, Ston is the Gateway to the Peljesac Peninsula, the Heart of Croatia's booming wine industry. We sampled some impressive white wines from the region and drove through the rugged countryside punctuated by vineyards.  Ston it self is a Medieval city renowned for its salt production, the salt flats originally built by the romans over 1000 years ago are still operational today and make an enjoyable stop and the perfect spot to view the walls of Ston as they zigzag up the mountain, protecting the city.  Lunch by the sea in Mali-Ston is a must, especially if you like Seafood. The Restaurants rely on local fisherman and the daily menu is dominated by the fresh offerings that have been brought from the sea that morning.
