This is a place where I dream. And reflections of places it dream of being. When I'm traveling and wandering a new city with my camera, I often point it up.. I love building details contrasted on blue skies - a composition without context. This photo is in Waikiki. Amidst a busy bustling business and tourist district littered with buildings reaching skyward, seeking sunset views. but by removing the context from the photo, we enter a calm place where we can look at form and shape, colour and texture, shadow and light.
