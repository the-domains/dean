Each October, Vancouver's Mountainview cemetery holds a "Night for all Souls" -an artist-led series of events and art installations throughout the cemetery grounds. Many different cultural and faith traditions are represented and as you wander the dark cemetery grounds you interact with and see many of these. Scandinavian logs cut so they burn from the inside out. Buddist Prayer papers fluttering int he breeze. New Orleans Jazz bands wandering in the night. First Nations Birch bard canoe cribs flying up.

It is a sombre, yet joyful experience that is hard to explain. Somehow in the darkness of the night there is a celebration. it is a night of contrasts. Candle light versus dark night, Silence versus noise. respectful cultural practices and trick or treaters. Some how it all works and an hour or two spend exploring is good nourishment for the modern weary soul. You are sure to have a few doors of perception inched open.
